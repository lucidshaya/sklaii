# Skilled Learners Platform and AI Learning LMS

Welcome to the **Skilled Learners Platform**, an AI-powered Learning Management System (LMS) designed to provide personalized education experiences. This platform leverages artificial intelligence to offer adaptive courses, intelligent progress tracking, and tailored recommendations, making learning engaging and effective for users.

## Overview

The Skilled Learners Platform is a full-stack web application built to revolutionize online education. It features:
- **Public Course Access**: Browse and explore a variety of courses without logging in.
- **Authenticated User Features**: Protected routes for progress tracking, user profiles, and settings, accessible only to logged-in users via Clerk authentication.
- **AI Integration**: Personalized course recommendations and potential future features like AI-generated quizzes.
- **Light Mode Design**: A user-friendly, light-themed interface for an enhanced learning experience.

The project is divided into a frontend (React) and a backend (FastAPI with Python), with a focus on scalability and AI-driven enhancements.

## Features

- **Courses**: Publicly accessible course catalog with detailed views.
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitor your learning progress on protected routes.
- **User Profile**: Manage personal details securely.
- **Settings**: Customize your experience (e.g., theme, notifications).
- **Authentication**: Secure login and signup using Clerk.
- **AI Recommendations**: Basic content-based filtering for course suggestions (expandable with machine learning).
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for desktop and mobile with Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui.

## Technologies

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React with Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
- **Authentication**: Clerk
- **State Management**: React Query
- **Routing**: React Router DOM

### Backend
- **Framework**: FastAPI
- **Database**: SQLAlchemy with SQLite (scalable to PostgreSQL)
- **AI**: NumPy, scikit-learn for initial recommendations
- **Authentication**: Clerk JWT integration
- **Deployment**: Uvicorn server

### Development Tools
- **Node.js**: For frontend dependencies
- **Python 3.12+**: For backend (Python 3.13 may require adjustments)
- **pip**: Package manager for Python
- **Git**: Version control

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** (v18+)
- **Python** (3.12 recommended; 3.13 may need workarounds)
- **Git**

### Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/skilled-learners-platform.git
   cd skilled-learners-platform
   ```

2. **Frontend Setup**
   - Navigate to the frontend directory:
     ```bash
     cd frontend
     ```
   - Install dependencies:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```
   - Create a `.env` file in the `frontend` directory with:
     ```
     VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_clerk_publishable_key
     ```
   - Start the development server:
     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```
   - Access the app at `http://localhost:5173`.

3. **Backend Setup**
   - Navigate to the backend directory:
     ```bash
     cd ../backend
     ```
   - Create a virtual environment and activate it:
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
     ```
   - Install dependencies:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
   - Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory with:
     ```
     DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///app.db
     CLERK_SECRET_KEY=your_clerk_secret_key
     ```
   - Start the backend server:
     ```bash
     uvicorn app.main:app --reload
     ```
   - Access the API at `http://localhost:8000`.

4. **Initialize Database**
   - The backend will create the database tables automatically on the first run. Add initial course data manually or via a script if needed.

## Usage

- **Explore Courses**: Visit `/courses` to browse available courses.
- **Sign Up/Login**: Use `/auth` to create an account or log in.
- **Track Progress**: Access `/progress` after logging in to see your progress.
- **Manage Profile**: Update your details at `/profile`.
- **Customize Settings**: Adjust preferences at `/settings`.
- **AI Recommendations**: Check `/api/ai/recommendations` (via API) for suggested courses based on your activity.
